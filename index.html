    <p>I like <cat>cats</cat> because:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>because they're CUTE</li>
        <li>they're SOFT</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li><cat>cats</cat> are better than <code>dogs</code></li>
        <ul>
            <li>(some people think that)</li>
                <li>You don't have to take them on walks!</li>
            <li>Most of them don't beg you for food! (However, <code>dogs</code> ALWAYS do)</li>
            <li>They are very independent (You don't always have to play with them if you don't want to)</li>
        </ul>
